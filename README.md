# TicTacToe

The goal of this project for The Odin Project will be to create a webpage taht
has a functional tic tac toe game. Factory functions will be used to make the 
gameplay work.

The gameplay should be stored as an array in a Gameplay object. Additionally, 
code should be developed to intentionally leave as little code as possible
in the global scope
